The first thing I did is to extract the image metadata using an `exif tool` online.

`Exif`  is a standard for some file **metadata** (camera settings, geolocation etc…) such as images.

For this I used this tool: [https://jimpl.com/](https://jimpl.com/)

I did not find anything interesting in metada.

In the photo I checked a big Costco’s parking and in front of it a weird structure probably a **nuclear power plant.**

So I googled `costco nuclear power plant` on google images.

Found this:

Then I used the address found on google maps:

```
Costco
14 W Lightcap Rd
Pottstown, PA 19464
Estados Unidos
```

Then got the **flag**: `flag{philadelphia_premium_outlets}`
