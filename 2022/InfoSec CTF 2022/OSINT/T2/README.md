**Photo link**:

**Description**: We took a photo of this man on a horse, but we don't know who is it. Find out it and let us know flag{name}

The first thing I did is to extract the image metadata using an `exif tool` online.

`Exif`  is a standard for some file **metadata** (camera settings, geolocation etcâ€¦) such as images.

For this I used this tool: [https://jimpl.com/](https://jimpl.com/)

The only interesting medata was the date: `November 13, 2022 14:16` so the event was probably took on that date.

Zooming and searching information in the photo I found a signal with this name: `rembrandtplein` and googling it I found that is placed in **Amsterdam**, so I googled `Amsterdam November 13, 2022` and I found this:

So the person is `Saint Nicholas` then got the **flag**: `flag{Nicholas}`
